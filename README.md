# The Sparks Foundation Data Science and Business Analytics Internship Tasks

This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for The Sparks Foundation.

Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
Internship Duration - 1 Month ( June-2021 )
Internship Type - Work from Home

# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML 
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML
● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

# Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
